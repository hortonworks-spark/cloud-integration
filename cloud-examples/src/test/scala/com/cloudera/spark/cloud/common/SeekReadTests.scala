      """Assess cost of seek and read operations.
        | When moving the cursor in an input stream, an HTTP connection may be closed and
        | then re-opened. This can be very expensive; tactics like streaming forwards instead
        | of seeking, and/or postponing movement until the following read ('lazy seek') try
        | to address this. Logging these operation times helps track performance.
        | This test also tries to catch out a regression, where a `close()` operation
        | is implemented through reading through the entire input stream. This is exhibited
        | in the time to `close()` while at offset 0 being `O(len(file))`.
        |
        | Note also the cost of `readFully()`; this method call is common inside libraries
        | like Orc and Parquet.""".stripMargin) {
