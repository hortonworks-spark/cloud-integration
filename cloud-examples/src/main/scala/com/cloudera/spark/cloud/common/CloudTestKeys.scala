/**
 * The various test keys for the cloud tests.
 *
 * Different infrastructure tests may enabled/disabled.
 *
 * Timeouts and scale options are tuneable: this is important for remote test runs.
 *
 * All properties are set in the Java properties file referenced in the System property
 * `cloud.test.configuration.file`; this must be passed down by the test runner. If not set,
 * tests against live cloud infrastructures will be skipped.
 *
 * Important: Test configuration files containing cloud login credentials SHOULD NOT be saved to
 * any private SCM repository, and MUST NOT be saved into any public repository.
 * The best practise for this is: do not ever keep the keys in a directory which is part of
 * an SCM-managed source tree. If absolutely necessary, use a `.gitignore` or or equivalent
 * to ignore the files.
 *
 * It is possible to use XML XInclude references within a configuration file.
 * This allows for the credentials to be retained in a private location, while the rest of the
 * configuration can be managed under SCM:
 *
 *```
 *<configuration>
 *  <include xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="/shared/security/auth-keys.xml"/>
 *</configuration>
 * ```
